# Crystals
[Play here!](https://bsw975.github.io/Crystals/)

Building more advanced logic, storing stateful information, and getting more mouse-clicks from the player. Due at the start of the third week of classes, the homework is the Recommended, and not the Challenge option. The programmer used the simpler project to catch up on learning and thoroughly complete the work to be done.

The game randomly assigns different values to each of the crystals, and the player must track which crystal has which value. By totalling all the values all the clicks, the player can hit a target score.

The JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML interaction skills are quickly developed with this project, giving a solid base from which to grow.
